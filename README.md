**INTRODUCTION:**
The project aims to improve accessibility and affordability while promoting automation and
accountability. The IoT-enabled vending machine offers real-time, hassle-free access
to products and an non-cash or coin payment system through barcode or QR
code scanning, ensuring a seamless user experience. We highlight the pivotal
role of the Raspberry Pi in managing the vending machine's operations and interfacing
with the IoT ecosystem. The system is designed to facilitate real-time transactions,
update individual student accounts, and employ LED indicators for balance
notifications and operational status.

**NEED OF PROPOSED SYSTEM:**
1) Automated Vending Machine
2) Cashless Payment
3) Ensure Balance Notifications
4) Promote Convenience and Discretion

**LIBRARIES:**
1. cv2 (OpenCV)
Used for accessing the camera, capturing video frames, and displaying output.
2. pyzbar
Used to scan and decode barcodes or QR codes from images or video frames.
3. openpyxl
Handles creating, reading, and modifying Excel files (.xlsx).

**COMPONENTS:**
1) Raspberry pi
2) DC motor
3) LED indicators
4) camera module
